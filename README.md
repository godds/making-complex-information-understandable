#From Aargh To Oh! Making Complex Information Understandable

All walks of life are being affected by the ever-increasing size and complexity of information (potentially) available to us, but we cannot all be expected to be data scientists. Fortunately, design thinking is beginning to permeate enterprise organisations, resulting in information services,line-of-business and productivity applications finally receiving the design attention their, often extensive, daily use warrants. These projects pose a particular kind of design challenge that requires more conventional UX techniques to be adapted and re-appropriated.

In this session, I will take you through my approach to making complex information understandable and actionable for users. I will explore aspects such as the delicate balance between overview and detail; the suitability of data visualisation versus numbers in different circumstances; and how the information should simultaneously raise and answer questions for the user.

Along the way, you will learn something about the world of energy trading as I draw on a recent project with a Nordic power exchange for illustrative purposes.
